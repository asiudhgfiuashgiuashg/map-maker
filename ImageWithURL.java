 * This class keeps track of the URL of the Image, which the vanilla Image class doesn't do.
 * We need to keep track of the URL of the image because the best known way to scale Tile and Object Images upon zoom is
 *  to load the Images with their requestedHeight and requestedWidth multiplied by a scalar. Attempting to scale the imageviews with the existing images
 *  results in blurry images, but we want pixelated images.
